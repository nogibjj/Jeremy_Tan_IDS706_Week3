## Purpose of project
The purpose of this project is to transform the previous project (Pandas descriptive statistics) into generating descriptive statistics on datasets using Polars. I made two functions in main.py: "general_polar_describe(csv)". The function reads a dataset and provides descriptive statistics on any csv file a user passes in. I test the function in test_main with "test_general_describe()". The second part of the project is to generate visualizations of the dataset and generate a report. I include a generateed pdf of one of the datasets I chose, congress-terms.csv, using ydata-profiling. I've include pictures of the visualizations and the data returned from .describe() and .median() for your reference. 

## Preparation
1. open codespaces 
2. wait for container to be built with requiremnts.txt installed

## Check format and test errors
1. Format code `make format`
2. Lint code `make lint`

## Visualizations
Visualizations can be ran by using `python test_main.py` calling `test_viz_general()`

## Some summary statistics of congress dataset
You can either view the summary report generated by ydata-profiling (congress_csv_profile.pdf) or view the generated .md file (congress_summary.md) via github actions `generate_and_push`. For better viewing, view the raw .md file.
